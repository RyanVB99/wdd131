            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <h3>Per Te</h3>
            <p>(Body text uses the Roboto font) - Per Te is Italian for "For You". This may or may not be the final name as it is not very descriptive, but I want a name that is simple and interesting.</p>
            <p>I like how "Per Te" sounds, I like the meaning as I enjoy cooking "for" people, and it shares a name with a song I have loved most of my life.</p>

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>What are some elegant recipes I can make?</li>
                <li>I want to see examples of upscale multi-course meals.</li>

            <h2>Colors</h2>
            <p> I'm not sure yet what colors I am going to use. Currently, I'm leaning towards the colors you see here (white, beige, brown and black). They don't quite 'feel' the way I want, but they get the job done.</p>
